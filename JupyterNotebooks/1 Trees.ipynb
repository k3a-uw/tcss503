    "# TCSS503 - Week 1 Tree Review\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple interactive tutorial, we will create a Binary Search Tree (BST) using two underlying representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do, we need to remind ourselves what a Binary Search Tree is, what properties it has, what is valuable about those properties, and how do we interact with a BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Search Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A Binary Search Tree is a special tree with the following special property:\n",
    "* For each node in the tree all nodes in its **left** subtree are less than its value.\n",
    "* For each node in the tree all nodes in its **right** subtree are greater than or equal to its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: The left side can be less than or equal to (inclusive), and the right side can be greater than (exclusive).  That detail is left up to the implementation.  The right can also be lesser, and left be greater.  As long as it is consistent the value from these properties holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this property, we can search for any value in the tree using Binary Search, a $O(log n)$ algorithm that quickly locates a particular item in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Methods\n",
    "The most common methods for a BST are `put` or `insert` where a value is added to the data structure.  The second common method is `get` or `search` where data is pulled out of the data structure.  Lastly, `remove` or `delete` will first locate a particular value and remove it from the tree.  Details of the implementation will be explained in each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representations\n",
    "There are two most common representations of a Binary Search Tree, `Dynamic` and `Sequential`.  A `Dymanic` representation uses Nodes connected through parent and child links.  A `Sequential` implementation of a tree uses an _Array_ of objects representing the complete structure of the tree.  Each method has advantages.  A `Sequential` implementation has random access to all nodes via index and has less overhead in maintaining links.  However, it assumes a complete tree, so for sparse trees, more memory is consumed than is needed.  The `Dynamic` representation only uses the memory needed for the number of nodes in the tree but tree traversal algorithms are required to scan the entire data structure if that is ever needed.\n"
