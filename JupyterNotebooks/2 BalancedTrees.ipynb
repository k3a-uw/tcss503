    "In this simple interactive tutorial, we will create a **Red-Black Tree**.  A Red-Black Tree is an implementation of a Binary Search Tree that grows from bottom to top, maintaining its balance to guarante a $O(\\log{n})$ time complexity for Inserts and Searches.\n",

    "## Red-Black Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A Red-Black Tree is method of implementing a 2-3 tree using Red links to represent connecting keys of 3-Nodes and 4-Nodes and Black links representing connections between nodes.   For more information on 2-3 Trees and why they function, please review chapter 3.3 of Algorithms (Sedgewick).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Node Data Structure\n",
    "The node structure of a RedBlack tree is similar to the node structure of any other tree with the exception that we maintain a color attribute to indicate that the node is connected via a Black link or Red link.  To determine if the node's left or right nodes is red, we can use the following expression: `node.left.is_red`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For illustrative purposes, I've included a string representation of the node that simply shows the left and right keys and the color of the links.\n",
